---- Correspondences ----

C6,C22: 22pF 
C21,C24: 10uF
C1,C2,C7,C9: 1uF (100V~)
C4,C5,C8,C10: 0.1uF (100V~)
C11,C12,C13,C14,C15,C16,C17,C18: 0.01uF
R10,R12,R14,R16: 100kΩ
R9,R11,R13,R15: 1kΩ
R38: 10kΩ
R48: 5.1kΩ

R17,R18,R19,R20: 330Ω (for 212 input)
R27,R28,R29,R30: 100Ω (for 210*2 input)
R31,R32,R37,R39: 10kΩ pull down
R33,R34,R35,R36: 51Ω ? (for 5551 base) (currently testing with 10Ω)

R42,R43,R44,R45: 0Ω/jumpers

R40: 51Ω (for 210*4 input)

R25,R26,R49: depends on the used LED, e.g., R25 1.5kΩ, R26 500Ω, R49 1.5kΩ with SML-310DTT86 (LED1/2), SML-512MWT86 (LED3) 
Note that you must change R26 if you use a different battery source, i.e., if not 3V. I am currently using 2.2kΩ and 560Ω. 

R1,R2,R3,R4,R5,R6,R7,R8,R41: 10kΩ (can be left unused, they are pull-down resistors but Arduino has pull-down elements in itself)
R46: 100kΩ (same as above)

R21,R22,R23,R24 should left open/unused. 

JP1,JP6,CN2 are sockets or pins which are used to connect with the Arduino.
JP2--JP5 are usually unused. You can use them to connect multiple boards, when using 5 or more channels.


---- Remarks ----

CN6 is an optional socket for battery connection. You can use this for Li-po batteries etc. Be careful not to use them simultaneously with other Vin sockets.

If you find the output stimulation too weak, you may change the inductor or power source (battery, 3.7V or 4.5V maybe). For the inductor, consider using inductors with a larger ampacity (e.g., 200mA~).
